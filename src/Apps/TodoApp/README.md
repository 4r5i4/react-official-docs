# Application deliverables:


1. show input
   1. input box
   2. _add_ and _clear input_ buttons
2. show list of TODOs
   1. every list item will have a _done_ and _remove_ button
      1. _done_ items will display strike-through text
         1. __later iteration__: will split after "done" to see if it was fully done (in green) or partially done(orange); perhaps adding proper tags to them, not just color coded!
            1. if _partially done_, prompt to see what is remaining and add it to the TODO list
      2. _remove_ items will be removed
         1. order will be maintained properly among the remaining items
         2. removed items will be shown in a trash bucket listed with their date
            1. __later iteration__: will have a modal asking the reason for removal
3. show widgets. Examples would be:
   1. weather report
   2. tasks done report
   3. the _trash can_ containing removed items
   4. "What is your main focus for today"
